# Chinese-English Exchange Resources

The resource document list for the Chinese-English exchange discord server: https://discord.gg/ADdR45y. Mostly tailors to learning Mandarin and Cantonese. Links dialects, Classical, and older Chinese however are more than welcome.

If you find any problems with these resources listed or have suggestions, please leave comments in the resources channel of the discord. Many of these links have not been vetted, so usage experience is more than welcome.

Mandarin and Cantonese lessons sections should be focused around getting a person with no knowledge to beginner/intermediate level. Once they reach that point, they should be looking towards native content for self-study.

# Guides/Textbooks

- There are three ways that Cantonese is romanized. You’ll likely have to get use to all three. Older resources use Yale, newer use Jyutping, natives just fudge it as no romanisation system is taught. Also take a look at Mandarin section for some start character tips should it be relevant (since this primarily spoken language).
