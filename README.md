# Chinese-English Exchange Resources

The resource document list for the Chinese-English exchange discord server: https://discord.gg/ADdR45y. Mostly tailors to learning Mandarin and Cantonese. Links dialects, Classical, and older Chinese however are more than welcome.

If you find any problems with these resources listed or have suggestions, please leave comments in the resources channel of the discord. Many of these links have not been vetted, so usage experience is more than welcome.

Mandarin and Cantonese lessons sections should be focused around getting a person with no knowledge to beginner/intermediate level. Once they reach that point, they should be looking towards native content for self-study.

### HSK

- [HSK Academy](http://www.hsk.academy/) - Very helpful for those learning Chinese characters. Aimed mainly for those seeking the HSK (similar to TOEFL) tests, but still good to learn new words, phrases. There is a short introduction to Chinese grammar also.

- [Conversion](http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/hsk/hsktestscore.php) - Old HSK to New HSK

## Cantonese Resources

There are three ways that Cantonese is romanized. You’ll likely have to get use to all three. Older resources use Yale, newer use Jyutping, natives often use the third. Also take a look at Mandarin section for some start character tips should it be relevant (since dialect learning focuses on speaking).

## Dictionaries

Because of disconnect between phonetic reading and graphic representation of hanzi, knowing how to seperate character into its radical and phonetic component in addition to learning characters by their strokes. Not only number of strokes but order of strokes is especially useful for getting handwriting recognition to work for you.

More important introduction coming soon. Such dictionaries are organized by pinyin, but also come with a character index at the start that is organized by number of strokes in the radical, then by number of strokes excluding the radical.

### Recommended

- [Line](http://www.linedict.com/) (formerly Nciku) [EN→ZH][EN←ZH][EN↔Thai][Online] Most examples, flexible handwriting detection, and has the features. A tad bulky/slow. 
- [CantoDict](http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dictionary/) [EN↔CA][Online] Jyutping, audio bytes, examples. You have to make sure you select the right category for searching.
- [Zdic](http://www.zdic.net/) [C↔C,EN][Online] Etymology, stroke-based IME lookup, dialect readings (音韵方言), etc.
- [Jyutdin](http://words.hk/) [CA↔CA][Online]
- [MDCG](http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php) [EN↔ZH][Online] A fairly lightweight and responsive C-E and E-C Mandarin dictionary based on CC-CEDict.A2 Can search sentence for easy of searching multiple vocabulary but do not rely on it to parse.
- [Cantofish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cantofish/) (FF) or [CPD (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cantonese-popup-dictionar/pjnbhojkojmibobcpfgihhnohboldhip) [EN↔CA,ZH][Browser] Popup dictionary much like Rikai. Firefox version supports Jyutping, Yale, Pinyin. Supports Anki import.
- Zhong Wen ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/zhong-wen/)) ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zhongwen-chinese-english/kkmlkkjojmombglmlpbpapmhcaljjkde/support?hl=en)). Mandarin popup dictionaries available for both browsers. Still recommend Cantofish/PCD though they are Cantonese-based. Firefox versions not compatible with newest version yet.
- [Pleco](http://cantonese.org/) [EN↔ZH,CA][Android][iOS] CC-C-E dictionary based on CC-EDictA2 with a human check for differences for Cantonese. The app version for Android and iPhone are mandarin only. You have to enable Cantonese in settings for the mobile app.

Recommend getting a Cantofish over (even for Mandarin), especially if you plan on doing any sort of learning through reading.

### Other

- [Zhongwen](http://www.zhongwen.com/) [EN↔ZH][Online] (Unrelated to popup dictionary). Lightweight and responsive. Alternative to Wenlin for radical-based breakdown of characters and shared-radical map. However, character search does not work (might be encoding issue) and unable to copy paste.
